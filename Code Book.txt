The features selected for this data set originate from a University of California, Irvine study using accelerometer and gyroscope raw signals. The feature_info.txt file included in the data set gives explanation to the methodology:

"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions."


In this analysis:

The signals are linked to a subject and that subject's activity when measurement was taking place.

Activities are coded with integers 1-6 as follows:
	1: WALKING
	2: WALKING UPSTAIRS
	3: WALKING DOWNSTAIRS
	4: SITTING
	5: STANDING
	6: LAYING

The observed signals during each subject's activities are used to calculate Average and Standard Deviation of all signals in that measurement window.

The resulting data is an average of averages and standard deviations for each subject and that subject's activities.

These results are represented as follows:

Subject = Participant in UCI study (numbered 1-30)
Activity = Description of activity during measurement
Average Mean = Average of the means of all observations for that subject during that activity in Hertz (Hz)
Average Standard Deviation = Average of the standard deviations of all measurements for that subject during that activity in Hertz (Hz).
